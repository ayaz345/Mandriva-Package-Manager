NEWS
=========

0.8.0
- Now we have Install/Remove/Upgrade features; :) (*)
- To deal with it some restructure were made and dialog boxes
  were added;
- Search has regex capabilities now;
- Tableview interaction has been improved;
- Statusbar is now fixed on the bottom and the splitter has
  its own shape. An overall progress bar is displayed on the
  statusbar. If you hover on it progress detail banner becomes
  visible;

(*) NOTES:
    1) Due to some limitations on current version of mdvpkg,
       only *one* action can be executed at a time. It should be
       changed on future versions.
    2) No automatic conflict resolution is available on current
       mdvpkg version, neither resolution helper. So, the user
       needs to deal with any kind of conflict resolution by
       himself; *Be careful*
    3) Automatic Media update is not available either, so it's
       up to the user to make such updater;
       (as root, use 'urpmi.update -a' to update all medias)
