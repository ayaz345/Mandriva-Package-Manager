- This is a tech preview (pre-pre-alpha) for the new "MPM".
- Be aware that even the name is a preview. :)
- Currently it has only basic search (and filters) capabilities.
No install/remove/update is available yet.
- It is crashing sometimes. We are investigating, but it seems to
be related to qt-desktop/'libqtdeclarative' issues.
- The scrollbar implemented is meant to be temporary, so it is far
from perfect, lacking sync with Flikable and better Model reset.
The application may freeze sometimes due lost of sync with Model when
using the scrollbar.
- Themes and layout are and investigation too, so do not worry if it
seems 'ugly' or terribly formed. But do not hesitate to give us a
feedback, so you can help us to improve it.
- The Advanced and Settings pages are not implemented yet.
- Also, we do not have a details page yet.

If you find something wrong, just let us know.
Thanks,
Paulo - paulo@mandriva.com
